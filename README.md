<strong>Brief summary</strong>

I started building the app by first creating a mock up of the form, this helped me to split the app down into its individual compments. I chose to use the React-Bootstrap framwork to write the JSX because its accessible and responsive by default and makes creating forms easier.

I faced a few obstacles while making the app; firstly deciding which component to start with, installing and implements the Bootstrap framework (despite being familiar with the standard Bootstrap framwork), and also implementing local storage. However, I enjoyed the challenges and learned a lot :)
